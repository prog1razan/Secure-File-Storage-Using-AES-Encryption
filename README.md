## 🧠 What is AES?

**AES** stands for **Advanced Encryption Standard**.  
It’s a **symmetric encryption** method — meaning it uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.  
AES processes data in **blocks of 128 bits**, providing both **security** and **efficiency**.

## 🌍 Where is AES Used?

AES is used in many real-world applications, such as:  
- Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal  
- File encryption tools like BitLocker and FileVault  
- Cloud storage platforms like Google Drive and iCloud  
- Wi-Fi security (WPA2/WPA3)  
- VPNs and online banking systems
